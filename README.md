Up, up, and away!
================

As the newly hired Front-End Web Developer team for Blast Off! Industries, you've been given a list of updates to the website from design and marketing that need to be implemented.

Work with your team to check off the items on the list.

1. The font used on the page doesn't represent our brand well. Find the Google Web Font called "Exo" and use that throughout the page.
2. The font size is too small in the navigation. Let's make it 20px.
3. We want the navigational text to be all uppercase.
4. Can we get rid of the underlines on links?
5. For the active page in the navigation, make it bold instead of italic.
6. Add a 1px white border to the rocket image.
7. There is not enough contrast between the text in the main and the background color. Can we make the background a lighter grey color?
8. The copyright text is out of date, update it. It's 2016!
9. The rocket image is missing an alt tag. We should add one.

BONUS:

10. Add keyword and description meta tags for better Search Engine Optimization.
